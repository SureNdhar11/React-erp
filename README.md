TITLE - MOBILE SHOPPING 

PRODUCTSLIST:
              In this module, I create a feature to show the available products in the shop. 
              The available products are listed with their details, including the Model Name, Manufacturer, Price, and Product Description. 
              Additionally, there is an option to "add to cart". When clicked, the product is added to the cart, and the updated product list is displayed.
ORDERLIST:  
              In this module, I create the order list of products the customer wants to buy. 
              It displays the cost, which will be "subtotal + Tax (included) = Total Cost". 
              It also provides options to add and delete items.

SEARCH FOR PRODUCT:
              Go to the product list and search for what you want. 
              If your search matches an available product, it will be shown first. 
              If your search does not match any available products, it will be labeled as "not available," and an error will be suggested for your search term.

THEME:
        Light Mode
        Dark Mode
